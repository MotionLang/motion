# Motion 


Motion is a dynamically typed general purpose programming language with a familar syntax.

Motion is created in pure C, with no dependancies.

Motion is a variation of the Lox language found at www.craftinginterpreters.com.

## Contribution:
Motion is still in development. As such, I want to implement the basics as a solo project before others help. Please wait for version one before creating requests.
Otherwise, support of any kind is welcome!

## Compiling:
If you want to compile, first clone the repo.

Then, use the following command:
```
gcc  -fdiagnostics-color=always -g -Wall *.c -o output
```
Alternatively, in vscode, use the ```tasks.json``` file found in ```./vscode```.

After compilation, run 
```
./output
```
in a terminal.

Makefile suppport coming soon.

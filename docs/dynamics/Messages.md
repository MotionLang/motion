## Messages
Motion is built around a series of messages. This lets you write dynamic, responsive code.
By default, motion has two messages: ```@ok``` and ```@error```.
These are automatically returned from and can be passed to a ```dynamic```.

You can create a message like so:
```
msg @<name>;
```
Where ```<name>``` is the name of the message.

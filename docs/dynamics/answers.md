Motion is built around a series of calls and answers. This lets you write dynamic, responsive code.
By default, motion has two answers: ```@ok``` and ```@error```.
These are automatically returned from and can be passed to a ```dynamic```.

You can create an answers like so:
```
ans @<name>
```
Where ```<name>``` is the name of the answer.

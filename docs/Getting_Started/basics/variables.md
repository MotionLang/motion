## Variables:

Variables are created with the ```var``` keyword, followed by an ```=>``` and their value, like so.

```
var x => 1;
```
Variables are dynamic, so no type annotations are required.

Variables can also be declared simply by typing the varible name after the var keyword:
```
var y;
```
All variables created this way are set to ```nil```.

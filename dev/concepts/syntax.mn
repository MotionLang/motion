-- Comments are cool

~~
Block comments. 

Special Variables start with "&", such as &result, &error, &out, &in, 
which describe the last function return, the last error, the last 
thing to stdout, and the last thing to stdin.

Macros start with "@", like @out, @in, @panic, @throw, @quit, which
print to stdout, get from stdin, calls to panic, throws an error, and quit, respectively.
@import precompiles the file/directory listed.

@import base;
@import "path/to/file.mn";
@import "path/to/directory";

@out "Hello World!"; -- print to console

fn swapNumbers <a, b>:
    check:
        %num <a>; -- checks if local param <a> is num type
        %num <b>;
    catch &error == %typeError:
        @out "Input Values were not numbers!";
        @panic;
    end;

    valid:
      let temp: <a>;
      <a> = <b>;
      <b> = temp;
    end;
    
    result:
      <a>;
      <b>;
    end;
end;

let %arr types: 
  "%num",
  "%int",
  "%flt",
  "%str",
